[officeaddin-outlook - Office Add-in for Outlook using Node.js & Angular](officeaddin-outlook)
-------------------------------------------------
This sample demonstrates how to create an Office Add-in for Outlook using non-Micosoft technologies. Office Add-ins are web applications that are referenced by the hosting Office client application. In this sample the web application is implemented as an [Angular 1.3.x](http://angularjs.org) application with two views that calls a server side WebAPI implemented [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org). All JavaScript in this sample is written using [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org).
